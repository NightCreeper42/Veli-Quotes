There's no end to your disappointment.
What disappoints me is that you're not nerdy enough.
You have failed being nerds.
You foolish child!
Morozov! Tell me why you have pulled a Tamir.
Tamir, if you fail your exam, I'll throttle you.
Shut up and have a Galaxy!
Don't worry about Tamir's mental health.
Don't be the pom pom boy.
I will not allow abuse, only I will abuse you.
See, you're just weird.
Give me ammunition against Tamir.
Stop worrying about what other people think, worry only about what I think.
What's the expression? "Don't be so salty".
Do NOT put that down.
Yes, I've noticed the ducks, Tamir.
It's oregano; if you were healthy, you'd know.
It's not a brag, it's a fact.
Why are you so weird? Stop eating that plant.
Don't be a Tamir.
